I think widespread casual financial recommendations are a symptom of a societal gambling addiction illness which should be treated by driving our society towards well-researched, meaningful and sustainable progress.   

- **Context and Issue**
  - Casual financial recommendations are widespread and confidently presented.
  - Society increasingly values shortcuts and instant gratification.
- **Risks and Consequences**
  - Popular investment tips often lack thorough analysis and resemble gambling.
  - Casual advisors typically bear no accountability for their advice.
  - Cultural acceptance of unaccountable advice undermines truth and responsibility.
  - Informal financial advice parallels unqualified medical recommendations, ignoring expertise.
  - Stakes involved include significant financial and personal security risks.
- **Broader Implications**
  - Viewing investment as gambling compromises genuine wealth-building and risk management.
  - This casino-like mentality affects broader societal aspects beyond finance.
  - The pursuit of effortless success reflects deeper existential and validation issues.
- **Conclusion** 
  - Society’s preference for instant rewards indicates a broader cultural failing. We should driving our society towards well-researched, meaningful and sustainable progress.
